# KCodeRag Nav for Cursor

This generated tree is the Cursor asset set consumed by the public `kcoderag-nav` project
installer. It contains the QA MCP projection, graph-first navigation Rule/Skill, update and
successful-call hooks, plus the canonical code-style knowledge files used by supported host
projections.
Asset presence is not host-delivery evidence. This tree is not a marketplace or user-directory
install source.

QA is the only public environment for MCP. The current package has two built-in capabilities:
`kcoderag-navigation` and `code-style-nudge`. Cursor receives the `$kcoderag`, `$kcoderag-manage`,
`$kcoderag-feedback`, and `$kcoderag-code-style` manual Skills. Cursor `3.17.8` has an exact
`UNSUPPORTED` receipt only for native automatic pre-write delivery.

## Install capabilities into one project

Use Node.js 22 or newer from the exact target project:

```powershell
npx kcoderag-nav@latest install --host cursor --capability kcoderag-navigation
npx kcoderag-nav@latest install --host cursor --capability code-style-nudge
```

Without `--host`/`--capability`, the CLI can interactively select Cursor and navigation.
Automation adds `--yes`. The CLI treats cwd or `--target PATH` as the exact project, does not walk
to a Git/SVN root, and rejects filesystem roots, user home, and host user config/plugin/cache roots.

The adapter owns only declared contributors under `.cursor/rules/`, `.cursor/skills/`,
`.cursor/mcp.json`, and `.cursor/hooks.json`. It preserves unrelated Cursor configuration and does
not modify another host's installation.

## Five project lifecycle commands

```powershell
npx kcoderag-nav@latest install --host cursor --capability kcoderag-navigation
npx kcoderag-nav@latest status --host cursor
npx kcoderag-nav@latest doctor --host cursor
npx kcoderag-nav@latest update --host cursor
npx kcoderag-nav@latest uninstall --host cursor --capability kcoderag-navigation
```

- `install` targets `installed ∪ selected`; an identical clean selection is a byte- and
  mtime-stable no-op.
- `status` is a fast, read-only report for all Cursor capabilities.
- `doctor` is a read-only deep scan of Cursor state and user sources, works before install, and has
  no `--fix` mode.
- `update` targets all installed capabilities unless repeated `--capability ID` flags filter them.
- `uninstall` requires an interactive selection, explicit capability, or explicit `--all`; it
  never defaults to removing everything.

All mutations preflight the complete target set and commit one transaction. One conflict, drift,
symlink, special file, unsafe target, or ambiguous owner makes the
entire request fail before the first write. There is no partial success.

## Cursor source, state, and integrity boundaries

An active Cursor plugin, raw MCP registration, manual Rule/Hook, retired install, or ambiguous
source is `source_conflict` with `ok: false`. The same source gate runs before install, update, and
uninstall. These findings are manual-only: the CLI reports stable metadata and safe paths, but does
not migrate, adopt, edit, invoke native removal for, or automatically clean user sources.

Only exact current capability-scoped schema v1 is valid. State binds the sorted capability set,
file/section contributors and digests, restorable originals, and one canonical composite digest.
Old environment-shaped/Python state has no decoder or migration authority. Removing navigation
recomposes shared files from any remaining contributors and restores an original only when its last
contributor is gone.

Complete integrity is checked before any native code-style once claim: current state, composite
digest, and every managed file digest must match. Missing or edited manual assets appear as
`capability_drift` in status/doctor; Cursor remains silent on the automatic path.

## Cursor capability boundary

Cursor navigation uses its always-on Rule, three navigation-family Skills, QA MCP configuration, `postToolUse` update
notice, and `afterMCPExecution` successful-call marker. It does not use or claim native
Codex/Claude `PreToolUse` delivery. The manual `$kcoderag-code-style` Skill is available, but a Rule,
packaged Skill, toast, or after-event is not
model-visible native pre-write evidence.

The CLI reads Cursor `3.17.8` strictly and evaluates its frozen digest-bound `UNSUPPORTED` native
receipt while still installing the manual style Skill. `status`/`doctor` report
`manualSkill: available` and `automaticNudge: unsupported`. Exact strings, current edits, and an
unavailable or stale index remain valid reasons to use scoped local search.

The `afterMCPExecution` marker and update notice store no MCP arguments, results, URL, headers, or
Bearer. The foreground update path reads only bounded local cache; a stale cache can detach the npm
Registry worker but never waits for network I/O, blocks a tool, or updates automatically. A known
notice suggests `npx kcoderag-nav@latest update --host cursor`.
Automatic update means automatic version awareness only: the worker never runs install/update, and
the explicit update command remains required.

Cursor does not use the Codex/Claude ancestor launcher. Its Rule, Skills, MCP, `postToolUse`, and
`afterMCPExecution` files move with a complete project copy or rename. Restart Cursor or run
**Developer: Reload Window** after install/update.

## Code-style marker manual reset and evidence boundary

On hosts where code-style guidance is supported, once claims live in the OS cache directory
`kcoderag-nav/nudges`. To reset them, first close every related Codex, Claude Code, Cursor,
OpenCode, and ZCode session, then delete the whole cache directory with an OS file tool, and reopen
the needed sessions. `status` and `doctor` are read-only; there is no cleanup command. Listing,
capacity-pruning, or deletion errors are fail-open and never block host work.

Phase 06 PACKAGED evidence proves Cursor navigation, manual code-style delivery, and silent native
non-delivery. It does not claim
authenticated real-Cursor MCP query evidence; that remains Phase 05 work. Connection and
authorization values stay opaque in generation, install, diagnostics, tests, logs, receipts, and
documentation.
